Students are not allowed to take electives marked for Grade 11 and 12 only.  (each course is one quarter long)Grades 11 and 12: Students are required to take two quarter electives by the time of their graduation.  This may entrail taking two quartered electives during your junior year, or one junior and one senior year. Spaces may be limited in some electives. Seniors are given preference. Grade 12 students cannot not enroll in Quarter 4 electives.There is a 4 absence allowance for all Quarter Elective classes. If a student surpasses the 4 absence allowance they must enroll in another elective in a different quarter to earn PE Graduation requirement credit and may require changes to their schedule in order to complete this requirement.*Covid-19 update:Members of the Class of 2022 and the Class of 2021 enrolled in Term 4 Physical Education classes, in order to meet the grade-level requirements for Physical Education will not have an opportunity to complete those credits because of our closing of the 2020 school year.  Making up this term in later years will substantially reduce opportunities for them to explore other academic offerings and will require them to take more than the usual amount of PE in one year.For this reason, we will reduce the Physical Education graduation requirement for the Classes of 2021 and 2022 by one term of Physical Education (requiring Grade 9 PE and a total of 3 quarters of PE during grades 10-12)",

We will scrutinize political, social and legal constructions of gender which continue to operate as though gender is binary, and explore a more inclusive approach which reflects a gender continuum within the context of entrenched power structures. Through understanding the construction of gender and its relationship with society, we will look for solutions to eradicate gender discrimination and gender-based violence.",

Newton’s Laws were taken to be absolute, then Einstein remade physics from the ground up. Yet still, engineers, architects, athletes, and surveyors all rely on Newton’s laws. Science is our major current attempt at a self-correcting body of knowledge, but how does that really work? What must we assume, in order to do science? Is science a handy set of beliefs and processes that tend to give us the results we seek? Or is it a matrix of ideas that directly reflect the world as it is?  Can science represent the world with complete accuracy? If not, what does it take for us to consider an idea justified enough to believe it or call it “true”? We will be exploring the development of science in the Western world, mostly in a historical perspective, and try to come to grips with some of these questions. It is fervently to be hoped that this deeper perspective will increase students’ appreciation of science, while decreasing the sense of oracular mystery that can surround it.

  "classDescription" : "About 2,500 years ago, a thread of analysis of ordinary experience arose which has continued to this day.  My thumbnail definition of philosophy is: The study of those questions that we have to assume we know the answer to just to conduct our daily lives. Examples of such questions include: How do I know when I know something? What kind of society should we build? What makes a society better than another? What obligations do I have to my family, my friends, to strangers, or to the state? Are we able to choose our actions freely, or does everything that happened to us, combined with the laws of physics, close off all decisions I can think of, except one? Does the universe care about us, or are we just kind of here?  All these questions have been addressed over the centuries, and we still do not have universal agreement on the answers. We will look into some prominent answers from the past, and wrestle with the questions ourselves. Philosophy is difficult to study because it is a debate, not a single body of agreed-upon answers. It is also difficult to study because we really, really like our own views. This course does not fulfill the science graduation requirement.",

Students compose literary analyses and expository essays with a clear focus, logically related ideas, and supporting detail to uphold their arguments. In creative writing, students work to develop a strong voice and to integrate literary elements, such as figurative language, characterization, and narrative structure. Students use their knowledge of the standard conventions of the English language to revise and edit their work. Students are encouraged to become active participants in the classroom through student-­centered discussions and oral presentations. To foster a positive attitude toward learning and to support students as they assume responsibility for their progress, the course provides instruction in critical thinking, reading strategies, and effective study habits.

Newton’s Laws were taken to be absolute, then Einstein remade physics from the ground up. Yet still, engineers, architects, athletes, and surveyors all rely on Newton’s laws. Science is our major current attempt at a self-correcting body of knowledge, but how does that really work? What must we assume, in order to do science? Is science a handy set of beliefs and processes that tend to give us the results we seek? Or is it a matrix of ideas that directly reflect the world as it is?  Can science represent the world with complete accuracy? If not, what does it take for us to consider an idea justified enough to believe it or call it “true”? We will be exploring the development of science in the Western world, mostly in a historical perspective, and try to come to grips with some of these questions. It is fervently to be hoped that this deeper perspective will increase students’ appreciation of science, while decreasing the sense of oracular mystery that can surround it.

  "classDescription" : "About 2,500 years ago, a thread of analysis of ordinary experience arose which has continued to this day.  My thumbnail definition of philosophy is: The study of those questions that we have to assume we know the answer to just to conduct our daily lives. Examples of such questions include: How do I know when I know something? What kind of society should we build? What makes a society better than another? What obligations do I have to my family, my friends, to strangers, or to the state? Are we able to choose our actions freely, or does everything that happened to us, combined with the laws of physics, close off all decisions I can think of, except one? Does the universe care about us, or are we just kind of here?  All these questions have been addressed over the centuries, and we still do not have universal agreement on the answers. We will look into some prominent answers from the past, and wrestle with the questions ourselves. Philosophy is difficult to study because it is a debate, not a single body of agreed-upon answers. It is also difficult to study because we really, really like our own views.This course does not fulfill the science graduation requirement.* Students have the option of earning Honors Credit through more extensive weather sampling and reporting, tests, and projects.",
