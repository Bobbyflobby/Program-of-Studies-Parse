Definition of the 5-credit Fine Arts Graduation Requirement              				    Grades 9-12
Our fine arts classes work toward the standards expressed in the Massachusetts Art Curriculum Framework. This Framework sets the expectation that all students in the Commonwealth’s public schools will become proficient in understanding the arts and communicating in at least one arts discipline by the time they graduate from high school. In dance, music, theatre, and visual arts, people express ideas and emotions that they cannot express in language alone. In order to understand the range and depth of the human imagination, one must have knowledge of the arts.  For this reason, courses fulfilling the Fine Arts requirement have their dominant focus on nonverbal expression, creation, creativity, and aesthetic education.  These courses value originality, stimulate imagination and creativity, and aim to deepen students’ learning by increasing their response to beauty in all of its forms.

Courses which currently fulfill the requirement for Fine Arts include:
Any course offered by the Visual Arts Dept. (see department subsection below)
Any course offered by the Performing Arts Dept. (see department subsection below)
In addition, the following Family and Consumer Science courses will fulfill the requirement:
CS1921Z  Interior and Fashion Design I
CS2921Z  Interior and Fashion Design II
AC3602Z Sculptural and Functional Woodworking
Definition of the Four Year Physical Education Graduation Requirement*
Grade 9: Students are required to take the 9th Grade Program.
Grade 10: Students are required to take two different quartered electives (preferably in the same semester). Students are not allowed to take electives marked for Grade 11 and 12 only.  (each course is one quarter long)
Grades 11 and 12: Students are required to take two quarter electives by the time of their graduation.  This may entail taking two quartered electives during your junior year, or one junior and one senior year. Spaces may be limited in some electives. Seniors are given preference. Grade 12 students cannot enroll in Quarter 4 PE electives because the length of 4 quarter 4 for seniors is shortened.
There is a 4 absence allowance for all Quarter Elective classes. If a student surpasses the 4 absence allowance they must enroll in another elective in a different quarter to earn PE Graduation requirement credit and may require changes to their schedule in order to complete this requirement.
*Covid-19 update:
Members of the Class of 2022 enrolled in Term 4 Physical Education classes in 2020 will not have an opportunity to complete those credits because of our remote status in  the 2020 school year.  Making up this term in later years will substantially reduce opportunities for them to explore other academic offerings and will require them to take more than the usual amount of PE in one year.

For this reason, we will reduce the Physical Education graduation requirement for the Classes of 2022 by one term of Physical Education (requiring Grade 9 PE and a total of 3 quarters of PE during grades 10-12)

Class of 2022 - will require 4 PE courses (9th grade PE and 3 quarter electives)
Class of 2023 - will require 5 PE courses (9th grade PE and 4 quarter electives)
Class of 2024 - will require 5 PE courses (9th grade PE and 4 quarter electives)
Class of 2025 - will require 5 PE courses (9th grade PE and 4 quarter electives)
Promotion and Graduation
Students must earn a passing final grade for the course in order to earn course credits towards graduation.  For a student to advance from one grade level to the next higher grade level, the following requirements should be met:
Grade 10		22 credits minimum
Grade 11		48 credits minimum
Grade 12		72 credits minimum
Graduation	           106 credits minimum

MCAS Competency Determination
Students must meet or exceed a score of 470 or higher on the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) in the subject areas of English Language Arts and Mathematics. Students who earn a scaled score between 440 and 469 on the English Language Arts and Mathematics examinations may receive a high school diploma only by demonstrating proficiency in the subject matter through completion of an Education Proficiency Plan (EPP) by continuing additional work in the targeted content area(s) through grade 12.

Students must also meet or exceed a scaled score of 220 on the Science, Technology and Engineering Exam in the one of the tested subject areas: Chemistry, Introductory Physics, Biology, or Technology/Engineering.
These are subject to change as the state updates the requirements.**

**Students whose year of graduation is 2022, 2023 will not be required to take the STE upon district certification that the student earned credit for a course aligned to the curriculum frameworks in the relevant subject matter and has demonstrated competency in one of the four tested disciplines (biology, chemistry, introductory physics, and technology/engineering) in either the 19-20 school year or a prior school year.

Waivers & Substitutions
Requests for relief/substitution of a graduation requirement must be made in writing to the Principal who has final decision-making authority on local requirements for graduation.
Procedure and Requirements for Early Graduation
Petition for Early Graduation Release must be made in writing to the Principal.
2. 	Application for Early Graduation release will be reviewed by the school counselor and the Principal, or his designee, to outline a program for completion of graduation requirements. The request will then be forwarded to the School Committee for a final decision.
3. 	Students accepted for Early Graduation Release are normally required to leave school at the same date all other seniors leave school.  Exceptions need to be approved by the Principal.
4. 	Students who intend to apply for early graduation must meet the following requirements: completion of all local graduation requirements, successful competency determination in Math, ELA, and Science on the MCAS exams, and a plan for the immediate future, signed by the student’s parent or guardian.
Course Makeup Policy
It is recommended that a senior who has not met the graduation requirements attend an approved summer school (high school and/or college) and make up credits or required courses immediately, in order to receive their diploma in August of the year they were to have graduated.  A diploma will not be conferred to a senior until they have completed all requirements towards graduation.

Any other student at the end of the freshman, sophomore or junior year is encouraged to make up credits or courses lost during that year.  This will help to ensure the proper credits necessary for graduation.  Students may not make up more than two required courses (English, Mathematics, U.S. History, etc.) in summer school.  The two-course limit on required courses applies to the student’s entire academic career at AHS and may not be interpreted as two courses per year.  Students with extenuating health related circumstances may appeal this limit to the Principal.
A student must have all summer school courses approved by the Principal or their designee prior to registering.
Prior to continuing in a sequential course, a student must pass an AHS proficiency examination as determined by the department chair for the subject. If the course is not sequential, a proficiency examination will not be required.
Enrichment courses may be taken any time at the discretion of the Principal.  The credit and grade will neither be used in the calculation of either GPA or weighted GPA, nor will the course be shown on the high school transcript.
Courses passed in summer school or courses that are taken through tutoring or outside of the normal semester or year-long timelines, become a part of the student’s permanent record.  The grade is recorded, but is not calculated in the student’s GPA or weighted GPA.  Maximum credit value can range from 2.5 to 5.0 credits, depending on the number of hours required in the study of that subject.

III. Introduction to Course Selection
The information contained in this Program of Studies is designed to guide students and parents in making important educational decisions for the upcoming school year. All course offerings are dependent on the finalized school budget, enrollment, and student need. The school reserves the right to delete or amend course offerings based on financial considerations.
Philosophy of Course Level Enrollment
The Arlington Public Schools encourage all students to meet their maximum potential. Recommended prerequisites are intended to identify the skills and competencies students should possess prior to enrollment in order to be successful in a given course. Required prerequisites that are not tied to sequential course offerings, i.e., you must take Spanish II before you can take Spanish III, are inconsistent with this vision and shall not be barriers to course selection. Teachers and counselors can provide specific assignments and samples of coursework to help students make their choices about appropriate courses and levels of study. While we encourage students to seek a challenging course of study, a schedule with 3 college-level courses (e.g., Advanced Placement) is generally considered to be our most demanding program.
Course Selection Guidelines
School Counselors work with students to choose the appropriate number and selection of required and elective courses for each individual student.
The number of students in a particular course will vary based on the requests of students. If there are an insufficient number of students requesting a particular course, the course will not be offered, and those students who have requested it will be assigned to one of their alternate choices.
Students who select a particular course at the time of the initial course selection should choose the appropriate level at that time. It may not be possible to adjust that level at a later date given the tightness of the class size/course selection process. Students should consult with their teachers and counselors to make the most appropriate educational choices. Changes will not be made in the fall if a class overload would result.
Students who are interested in college athletics will need to satisfy NCAA Eligibility Criteria which is available on their website, www.ncaaclearinghouse.org. All of the courses offered at AHS are designed to prepare our students for college. Historically, Curriculum A, Honors and AP courses have met these standards, while Curriculum B courses have not.   Students and parents are encouraged to look at the website to confirm for themselves that their courses meet these standards.
All Freshman, Sophomore and Junior students attending classes at Arlington High School will be scheduled for 32.5 credits per year (minimum).  All Seniors will be scheduled for 30 credits (minimum) per year.  Exceptions to the credit minimums must be approved by a school administrator.
All course schedules are subject to final approval of the administration.

Policy for Online Coursework and Dual Enrollment Coursework
Dual enrollment refers to the practice of students receiving credit from their high school for a course taken via a college or university, with the course included on both the high school and collegiate transcript.

Online learning, a practice where students learn in an asynchronous or synchronous format from a device-based platform is a broader term with no specific conditions in regards to high school credit.

Students whose medical needs render the student unable to remain in school for a full school day may petition, on a case by case basis, for acceptance of online coursework via their school counselor and Dean, who will seek approval for the requested online coursework with the department head of the subject of the course.

Arlington High School’s leadership team encourages the practice of obtaining credit and online learning credit via established partnerships between our school and external educational organizations.  This includes, but is not limited to, our courses offered in partnership with Syracuse University Project Advance,  the Global Studies Consortium course offered in partnership with Harvard Extension School, the DESE funded dual enrollment opportunities for public high school students offered via Framingham State University, and our blended learning course offered to groups of students via EdX and Coursera.  In addition, students may participate in a state offered dual enrollment program through community colleges such as Middlesex and Mass Bay Community Colleges.  Each of these opportunities is handled in ways specific to the program and it is important to check with your school counselor at the time of enrollment for specific course requirements.

Students are able to take courses, online or in-person from organizations not partnered with Arlington High School and to submit course descriptions and transcripts as additional information when they apply to college, but these experiences are not governed, sanctioned, or funded by Arlington High School and will not be reflected on the Arlington High School transcript.

Homeschool Students at AHS

Homeschool students are expected to remain in good standing, abide by the code of conduct and AHS attendance policies. Specifically, this means that the student will be subject to the following expectations.
The student will abide by the Arlington High School discipline code.
The student will attend class every day on time in accordance with the attendance policy.
The student will not remain on school grounds during their unscheduled time
The student will receive an AHS transcript for grades and credits earned.
Should the conditions not be followed, Administration may revisit the student's participation in classes at AHS. If the student is eligible for special education any change in services is subject to state and federal laws governing students eligible for special education.

Schedule Distribution Timetable
As has been the practice in previous years, final student schedules will be distributed by August at the latest.  Every attempt will be made to issue a preliminary schedule at the end of the school year or in early summer so that attempts to resolve errors, conflicts, and omissions can take place before the start of the new school year. While students may need to change courses based on their educational goals, no changes that unreasonably overload or imbalance the sizes of existing classes will be made.  In particular, changes based on teacher, rather than course preferences, will not be honored.

AHS Course Levels

The following course levels are offered at Arlington High School:

Advanced Placement - primarily for students in Grades 11 and 12, AP courses offer a fast-paced, intensive, college-level, exposure to a specific curriculum.  Students in AP courses must take the AP exam, offered by the College Board, at the end of the school year in order to receive AP credit for these courses.
Curriculum H - for students in Grades 9–12, Curriculum H courses are driven by independent student-work and, along with Advanced Placement courses, require the highest amount of student discipline, energy, effort, and organizational skills.
Curriculum A - for students in Grades 9–12, Curriculum A courses are college preparatory courses that cover rigorous content, college preparatory skill development, and specific instruction from teachers in study skills.
Curriculum B - for students in Grades 9–11 with teacher and school counselor approval only, Curriculum B courses allow for some remediation while still providing preparation for college and career. Students who are interested in Division 1 or 2 college athletics will need to satisfy NCAA Eligibility Criteria which is available on their website, www.ncaaclearinghouse.org.  Historically, Curriculum A, Honors and AP courses have met these standards.  Please note that the NCAA has not approved Curriculum B core classes at this point in time.
Heterogeneous courses - Courses with this designation are offered to all students. Students access the same curriculum at the same time with the same teacher. Teachers will differentiate instruction to ensure that all students are appropriately challenged by the curriculum and can reach their full potential. Although this practice is not new to Arlington High School, we are making an effort to ensure that all students take at least two heterogeneous classes in core content areas before they graduate, as required by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC). Students have the option of earning Honors Credit through more challenging research and project work. Students who are interested in earning Honors credit will inform the teacher in September.

IV. Report Cards
At the end of each school marking term, a report card is issued to each student. This report is available through the online parent portal and student portal or, upon request, is mailed home to parents or guardians.  All grades and attendance become a part of the student’s high school record. The following letter grades will be used in rating scholarship achievement in the courses taken:
Letter Grade Explanation
 A 	Superior work. Content knowledge, complex reasoning skills, and work habits exceed the standard for the course.
          B	   Proficient work. Content knowledge, complex reasoning skills, and work habits meet the standards of
      the course.
          C      Fair work. Content knowledge, complex reasoning skills, and work habits partially meet the standards
      for the course.
          D      Poor work. Content knowledge, complex reasoning skills, and work habits meet only the minimum
                   standards for credit in the course.
 F	Failure. Student has failed to demonstrate the minimum expectations for content knowledge and complex reasoning skills in the course.
 P	Pass. Student has demonstrated the expectations for content knowledge and complex reasoning skills and work habits in a course designated pass/fail.
 H	Honors
 S	Satisfactory
 U	Unsatisfactory
          W	Withdraw - Student withdrew from the class after the official date to be removed from a class.

Term Grades
The following grades may appear in the term grade for a course, but will not appear in the year-end grade for the course.
FA	Failure due to excessive unexcused absences (seven or more). The comment from the teacher will detail the grade the student would have received.
I	Incomplete. Requirements of course have not been met due to excusable absences.  Student will have a limited, agreed upon time to complete assignments.
NG	No grade.  Student was not present for sufficient amount of time to receive a grade.
M 	Medical absence (The quarter is not counted as part of the student’s final year average.)


Parent and Student Portal
At the beginning of each year, parents will be issued a password in order to check attendance and grades for their children at the high school. The information in the Parent Portal is provided by the staff to keep parents aware of both attendance and academic progress throughout each term and year. A password is also issued to each student to enter a Student Portal so that they may check on their daily progress in each class. It is the responsibility of students to address any concerns or difference of opinions with their teachers on attendance and/or grades that are posted in PowerSchool.
Final Exams
For full year courses, final examinations are scheduled at the end of the year.
For semester (1/2 year) courses, final exams will be administered at the end of each semester
The final examination counts for 11% of the final year grade for full year courses; 20% for semester courses.

Course Transfer/Withdrawal
A formal withdrawal procedure must be followed in order to change or withdraw from a course. A student should consult their counselor and teacher when a course change is being considered. When course changes are deemed appropriate, a change in programming will be made.

The final date to request a course change for a course will be 3 weeks after the first day of school.  For the few electives or other classes that are offered during second semester, the final date to request a change is 3 weeks after the first day of term 3. (See chart below for specific dates).  Any course change after this deadline will be reflected with a W in the term and end of year grade, but it will not impact their GPA. Please note, these deadlines are also applied to any student wishing to change from a heterogeneous level within a course to an honors level.

These dates will be finalized once the calendar year for 2021-2022 is finalized  by the School Committee

*these dates are subject to change as the schedule for 2020-2021 is finalized

When a student transfers from one level to another in the same content area (Honors Geometry to Curriculum A Geometry) the student’s grade for the course travels with him/her and is averaged into the final grade for the term in the receiving course.  When a student replaces one course with a completely different course, (i.e. Astronomy to French I) the grade does not travel with the student.  If a student enters the new class too late in the term to earn a grade they will receive an NG in the receiving class.  If it is determined that a student must change their schedule after the above deadline, teachers, department heads, counselors, special education liaisons (when applicable) and house deans can and will be involved in the decision to withdraw a student from a course and determine the grade adjustment for shifting levels or whether sufficient work exists to receive a grade.
Auditing Courses
The option to audit a course will be approved by the Principal in extenuating circumstances.  Auditing is a procedure whereby students attend a class for no credit.  It is understood that a student who wishes to audit a course and have a notation of that audit appear on the transcript must meet regular attendance and class participation standards in that class.

V. Transcripts and GPA
Unlike report cards, which list grades by quarter and semester, transcripts only list final grades. (Senior transcripts, in the first part of senior year, do carry term grades as a way of notifying colleges of the students’ academic progress in twelfth grade.) In addition, transcripts also list the students’ weighted GPA (Grade Point Average) and unweighted GPA. This information is provided unofficially by teachers, in Naviance and PowerSchool.  The only recognized official weighted or unweighted GPA is that which appears on an official school transcript. Note that students are not ranked at Arlington High School.
Grade Point Cumulative Average (GPA)
The grades a student earns will be averaged into a grade point average (GPA). The Grade Point Average is a student’s non-weighted grade point cumulative average based on the following translation for each letter grade of A, B, C, D or F.  The highest GPA is 4.3

A+ (97-100) = 4.3		A (93-96) = 4.0		A- (90-92) = 3.7
B+ (87-89) = 3.3		B (83-86) = 3.0		B- (80-82) = 2.7
C+ (77-79) = 2.3		C (73-76) = 2.0		C- (70-72) = 1.7
D+ (67-69) = 1.3		D (63-66) + 1.0		D- (60-62) = 0.7
                   	                                           	F (59 & below) = 0

Weighted GPA
The top weighted GPA is 5.0. The lack of availability of AP courses at 9th and 10th grade levels prevents any student from attaining a 5.25 weighted GPA, the top value for AP grade – see chart below.

Students receive credits for each quarter or term grade. The credits are factored in as part of the weighted GPA.  The final credits awarded for the course, however, are based on the student's’ Y1 grade, i.e., the student’s grade for the year.  Students who receive a passing grade for the year in a course, will receive full credit for that course.

Guidelines for Converting Grades and Credits for Transfer Students
In order to prevent disputes and misunderstandings revolving around the methodology and resulting determination of grade point average (GPA) for transfer students, and to preserve an element of fairness to students who have spent their whole academic careers at Arlington High School, the following guidelines will be followed:

The Arlington High School Class grade point average is designed to give information on students' general level of performance in the AHS course of study.  It is not realistic to assume that it can reflect with an unassailable level of accuracy student performance demonstrated under a different set of standards in place at other schools. Therefore, only grades earned at Arlington High School will be used for the purpose of computing grade point average.
Transfer students will receive credits for the courses they have taken at their previous high school(s) as transposed into the credit values for Arlington High School (5 credits, 2.5 credits, etc.)
Honors Speakers for Graduation
The Principal appoints the honors speaker(s) for graduation, taking into consideration, student scholarship, school citizenship, and effectiveness as a writer and speaker.

VI. School Counseling Services
Counseling services at Arlington High School are geared to the individual student.  Counselors work with students and parents on developmental issues, academic planning, course selection, personal issues, transition concerns, and the career/college search process. Counselors assist students to achieve their academic potential, while encouraging social and extracurricular experiences that provide opportunities for personal growth. Each year, counselors meet with their assigned students, in small groups and on an individual basis as needed, while collaborating with teachers and administrators regarding student progress.  In addition, the counselors hold group meetings for parents of grade 10, 11, and 12 students each year.

In the spring, counselors meet individually with students to select challenging courses for the upcoming school year.  Course selections, made by students and their parents, are further based on teacher recommendations, and post-secondary interests. Students are encouraged to explore their interests and to hone their talents through the selection of elective courses. Maintaining good grades and an appropriate level of rigor in course selection is emphasized.

School counselors utilize an online tool through the AHS School Counseling website. This program, called Family Connection/Naviance, is a customized planning and advising tool used to instruct all students on matters involving career and college research. Freshman groups focus on transitioning to the high school, goal setting, and involvement in school and community activities.  They are given a Naviance account where they complete a Learning Styles Inventory, which aids them in gaining an understanding of how they learn best, as well as a Multiple Intelligence Scale, which indicates each student’s strengths. They also begin the process of researching careers and colleges.  Sophomore groups revolve around MCAS, PSAT’s, course selection and extracurricular activities.  Students complete a Personality Profiler and a Career Inventory on Naviance, which exposes them to careers, college majors, and colleges, which best meet their interests and goals.  Sophomores continue to expand their search for college majors.  Junior groups focus on PSAT’s, SAT’s, and other standardized testing information. Students are taught how to conduct and fine-tune their college search using Naviance and other tools.  They are encouraged to visit colleges, and to interview with college representatives.  Counselors help juniors to develop a list of colleges and discuss acquiring teacher letters of recommendation. Seniors work with counselors in groups and on an individual basis to focus on matching their needs and interests to colleges which are a good ‘fit’. Students and parents are guided, step-by-step, through the college application process.

College/admissions representatives schedule meetings with students in the AHS Career Center in order to discuss their requirements and to review admissions criteria. These visits include representatives from two and four year colleges, trade schools, the military, year-off programs, and other alternative programs. AHS also sponsors a Spring College Fair, which hosts representatives from over 150 colleges and universities.

Post-Secondary School Placement
Placement and acceptance into post-secondary schools, especially four-year colleges and universities, both private and state-run, are affected by the following:
The student transcript: The transcript expresses commitment to learning by the nature and sequence of the course selected and by the marks received
Recommendations: The student’s counselor and teachers usually write recommendations. Recommendations give a picture of the student’s academic abilities as well as  their involvement in co-curricular activities-sports, music, art, political and community involvement in order to provide a personalized assessment of the student.
Test scores issued by the College Board or American College Testing Program
Co-curricular activities, athletics, clubs, service, internships, work experience, in school and in the community
National Standardized Tests
PSAT, SAT, ACT - The College Board of the Educational testing Service and the American College Testing (ACT) Service offer examinations whose scores are sought as part of the admission criteria by post-secondary educational institutions. Arlington High School conducts a Center for Admission testing Programs of the College Board for PSAT and SAT.  ACT test centers are available in the Metropolitan Boston Area. Sophomores are encouraged to take the Pre-ACT and Juniors are encouraged to take the PSAT to give information for test preparation and testing decisions.  Juniors also take the PSAT in order to qualify for the National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Program (NMSQP). Information about these tests is given at regular intervals through the School Counseling Office and the school calendar. Students work out a tentative calendar of testing with their counselors at the end of the sophomore year.
AP - The Advanced Placement Examinations provide the means by which secondary school students may demonstrate their readiness to undertake advanced courses as college freshmen.  These tests help colleges judge the qualifications of candidates for advanced placement and college credit.
TOEFL - The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) measures the ability of non-native speakers of English to use and understand North American English as it is used in college and
University settings.

Social - Emotional Counseling

School Counselors
The relationship a school counselor has with their students is a core component of the counseling program at AHS. Personal counseling is involved every time counselors meet with their students. Issues that arise are addressed based on the counselor’s assessment of the personal needs of each student. Students are encouraged to set up an appointment with their counselor to discuss problems and concerns. The counselors value the relationship with each of the students and strive to provide individual support for all students. Counselors are also a resource for parents. Parents should feel free to contact their child’s counselor if they have any questions or concerns.

When a student is in need of additional support, one of our school social workers may be of assistance in the situation. If a family or student is interested in services from a clinical social worker their school counselor can make a referral through our Student Support Team.

Clinical Services at AHS

General Services
The Intervention Coordinator/Social Workers offer and coordinate a range of support services at Arlington High School. The Intervention Coordinators provide crisis intervention, individual and group counseling, as well as consultation and support services to students, families, and professionals in the Arlington High School Community. Students are referred due to concerns around anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and behavioral struggles, among others. Deans, teachers, nursing staff, students, parents and school counselors can identify students in need or at risk. The Intervention Coordinator also makes referrals for clinical services in the community, and serves as a liaison to community agencies such as group homes, child welfare social workers, local mental health clinics and private therapists.

There are also several social workers within the Special Education Department (SPED) at the high school. These social workers provide support to students as deemed appropriate in their Individualized Educational Plans (IEPs). Please contact Special Education for more information.

All students returning to school following a hospitalization, safety evaluation, or extended absence, are required to attend a re-entry meeting with their parents/guardians prior to their return to school. In this meeting the student, parent/guardian(s), and appropriate school staff will discuss how the student & family feel about returning to school, make a plan for the student’s return to class, and assess and plan for managing make-up work and academics in a way that feels manageable and comfortable. If the student has been hospitalized then parents/guardians are asked to bring the Discharge Summary with them to the re-entry meeting. If the student was evaluated but not admitted to the hospital, please bring a letter of safety from the doctor who did the evaluation. Any other discharge paperwork is also encouraged. THIS IS REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION FOR RE-ENTRY TO SCHOOL.

The Shortstop Program
The Shortstop Program at Arlington High School is a short-term program providing tutoring and counseling support for students returning to school after an extended absence (7 or more days) due to emotional and/or medical reasons. The Instructional Specialist and Social Workers work closely with students and their teachers, enabling them to catch up with assignments and quickly return to classes. Students are offered up to two full days in the Program classroom, and up to eight additional days of help during their study blocks. Those students who require more support after Shortstop may be referred to the Harbor
Program.

The Harbor Program
The Harbor Program is a long-term support program aimed at addressing the academic, social, and emotional needs of students with chronic mental health or medical issues. The Instructional Specialists and Social Workers collaborate with students, families, teachers, and outpatient providers, individualizing each student’s support plan. Students in Harbor attend Homeroom, Advisory, and one scheduled Harbor Study block each day, as well as regular check-ins with their assigned Social Worker. Referrals to the Harbor Program are made through the School Counseling Department, Nursing, or Deans, and interviews are required for acceptance into the program.

Substance Abuse Services
The Intervention Coordinator, a clinical social worker in our School Counseling Department, also provides a range of support to students affected by substance use. Being caught with drugs or alcohol in or outside of school, or general concern from faculty, staff, or parent/guardian(s) may warrant a student being asked or required to complete an evaluation. Identified students participate in a one-hour evaluation after which the information gathered is used to determine the relative risk that this student may develop or continue to display a substance abuse problem. After this assessment students may be identified as needing a group or individual support and/or out of school support from a range of community resources. In addition, the Intervention Coordinator facilitates the Jive Turkeys, a student-named support group for teens considering making healthier decisions around drinking and other drug use. This group meets Tuesdays during the school day.

The Millbrook Program
Millbrook is an in-district, general education, transition and assessment program which assists in obtaining a better understanding of students social, emotional, academic and transitional needs.

Academic Support Services

The Learning Center                  						                  Grades 9, 10, 11, 12
The Learning Center provides a wide-range of academic support to accommodate the students' varied needs.  The teachers work with students clarifying assignments, reviewing content material, structuring and editing essays, supporting ELL students' language development, assisting with college and scholarship applications, and improving study habits and organizational skills.  The center is a quiet, structured learning environment where students can work together or independently to complete their assignments.  Helping students further develop their executive functioning skills is a major focus of the program.  Student progress is closely monitored through PowerSchool.  The Learning Center teachers communicate with classroom teachers, guidance counselors, and support staff on a regular basis.  Students are expected to bring materials and assignments to class and remain on task.  National Honor Society peer tutors are also available to provide additional support. Students can be scheduled into the Learning Center or drop-in during free periods or after school.

SS7806Z  Gender & Society (Semester course)    		Grades 11 & 12		                    2.5 credits
This course will examine why gender equality is so important and yet so hard to achieve. The central aim is to foster critical reading and thinking about gender and the ways in which it is shaped by the interlocking systems of racism, sexism, ethnocentrism, heterosexism, ageism, ableism, colonialism and globalization; and how social movements have resisted these inequalities and worked to create new systems of change. We will scrutinize political, social and legal constructions of gender which continue to operate as though gender is binary, and explore a more inclusive approach which reflects a gender continuum within the context of entrenched power structures. Through understanding the construction of gender and its relationship with society, we will look for solutions to eradicate gender discrimination and gender-based violence.

EN1110Z Foundations of English - Curriculum A	Grade 9	          		          5 credits
This course is designed to provide a foundation for success in the entire high school English program. To develop this foundation, students read classic and contemporary works, apply reading strategies, develop skills of literary analysis, and broaden their knowledge of literary terms.  The course involves the close reading and discussion of major literary genres including poetry, non­fiction, drama, the short story, and the novel. Because this course is a study of communication in all its forms, students also critically assess information in non-traditional “texts,” such as online media, advertisements, and news articles. Students compose literary analyses and expository essays with a clear focus, logically related ideas, and supporting detail to uphold their arguments. In creative writing, students work to develop a strong voice and to integrate literary elements, such as figurative language, characterization, and narrative structure. Students use their knowledge of the standard conventions of the English language to revise and edit their work. Students are encouraged to become active participants in the classroom through student-­centered discussions and oral presentations. To foster a positive attitude toward learning and to support students as they assume responsibility for their progress, the course provides instruction in critical thinking, reading strategies, and effective study habits. Other emphases include grammar and vocabulary development.

EN3000Z Advanced Placement Language and Composition AP Grade 11      	           	          5 credits
AP Language and Composition is intended for juniors who have demonstrated proficiency in composition and literary analysis and are ready to engage in college-level study of more sophisticated writing and effective rhetoric. Through thematic units the students will explore purpose and audience, the tools of effective argument, the elements of style, and the use (and misuse) of language. Through close analysis and synthesis of a variety of texts, students will develop their expository, analytical, and argumentative writing skills to address the essential question: How does the study of rhetoric enable one to be a contributing citizen and a conscientious consumer? While students will read novels of American literature, equal emphasis will be given to classic essays, speeches, political tracts, and literary criticism from such authors as Frederick Douglass, Deborah Tannen, Brent Staples, Richard Rodriguez, Annie Dillard, Perri Klass, Henry David Thoreau, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King,  Amy Tan, George Orwell, and others.  AP students will be expected to read deeply, prepare oral presentations and lead discussions. Portfolios allow students to reflect upon their accumulated work and establish individual writing goals. Grammar instruction, based mainly upon student writing, targets sentence complexity, variety, and precision.  Students develop and strengthen their command of language through the study of vocabulary drawn from the texts read in class.

EN3105Z American Literature - Curriculum H	Grade 11  	            		          5 credits
EN3110Z American Literature - Curriculum A	Grade 11   	            		          5 credits
The English 11 full-year American Literature program is an exploration of major American writers from colonial times to the modern day. Students explore the essential questions “What does it mean to be American?” and ”How does the American Dream change over time?”  Specific themes include the transition from innocence to experience, the conflicts between the individual and society, the realization of a moral code, and the pursuit of happiness. Selected novels and plays from the list above are supplemented by short stories, poems, and essays. As readers, students are challenged to engage texts purposefully in order to make meaning, generate critical questions, observe connections among texts, and defend interpretations with relevant evidence. As writers, students focus on crafting and supporting original claims through organized, fluid, and unified essays. Portfolios allow students to reflect upon their accumulated work and establish individual writing goals. Grammar instruction, based mainly upon student writing, targets sentence complexity, variety, and precision. Students develop and strengthen their command of language through the study of vocabulary drawn from the texts read in class.

English Grade 12

In order to graduate, students must enroll in and pass a full year of senior English. In the fall, students will spend time on the composition of the college essay and review for the final administration of the SAT. All courses will include regular writing assignments and a variety of reading experiences.

EN4000Z AP Literature and Composition	Grade 12	          5 credits
Advanced Placement Literature and Composition engages students in the careful reading and close textual analysis of complex, sophisticated and imaginative literature.  By reading fully and deliberately, by noting how meaning is embedded in literary form, students are given the tools to strengthen their knowledge of literary analysis and to foster a deep appreciation of literature. The writing in this course challenges the student to argue ideas clearly, precisely and elegantly in essays of critical analysis.  The assignments will be predominantly analytical and require students to demonstrate close reading of a text.  Some works that will be studied include Oedipus Rex, Heart of Darkness, Frankenstein, a novel by Toni Morrison, the plays of William Shakespeare, and a rich variety of poetry from many cultures and time periods.  Advanced Placement students are required to take the College Board's National Advanced Placement Test in May.

EN4266Z Memoir, Poetry and Fiction:	Grade 12   	           		          5 credits
Reading and Creating Literary Forms
Students in this course will have the opportunity to find their creative voices in three distinct areas.  The college essay will begin a study of memoir; students will then study the short story, and finally poetry.  In each case, writing will be informed by both classic and contemporary literature.  Memoirs by David Sedaris, Dave Eggers, Jeannette Walls; poetry by authors ranging from William Shakespeare to Robert Frost to Billy Collins; and short stories by Hemingway, Poe, Vonnegut, Chopin and many others will all give shape and texture to the literary forms that students will write.  Students will create a writing portfolio as the culmination of the year’s work.

EN7281Z Missing Voices, Other Cultures	Grade 12          	           		          5 credits
Literature often tells us about people whose lives are informed by the societies in which they live.  Whether defined by race or culture, exclusion or inclusion, power or weakness, characters in literature can help us to see how society shapes both behavior and motivation. Students in this course will hear the voices of people who have had to work to be heard, whether it is because of gender, beliefs, family background,  political realities, or other issues that have caused them to speak out as a means of defining themselves.  Students will write regularly in this course; analytical essays, personal essays, and formal presentations will offer students opportunities to hone the writing skills they have been working on throughout their high school years.

EN4168Z Poetry as Art	Grade 12                    		          5 credits
As one of the oldest art forms, poetry has become both a time-piece and a gallery of diverse expression.  It has inspired and informed works ranging from Homer’s classic epics to more contemporary forms such as rap and hip-hop.  More importantly, perhaps, it is a representation of our own life rhythm.  Seamus Heaney once wrote: “I rhyme to see myself.  To set the darkness echoing.”  In an effort to find our own rhyme, we will explore poetry from its most basic roots to its more sophisticated forms.  Instead of surveying poetry as a chronological timeline, we will bounce back and forth from the past to the present in order to discover how one has informed the other.  Haikus and sonnets, ballads and slam poetry will all receive equal attention.  Students will read, compose, and analyze poetry as an artisan might, by paying close attention to the process, the craft, and the history that informs our work.  While the majority of the writing in this class will be creative in nature, students will occasionally write expository pieces about poems as well.

EN7275Z Public Speaking (Semester Course)	Grades 11-12           		        2.5 credits
Sharpening communication skills, which rests on the ability to ‘stand and deliver,’ promises academic and professional success for life.  That remains the guiding belief of this course.  In a relaxed, supportive environment, students identify and cultivate strategies to most effectively express themselves.  In doing so, they discover their hidden voices and master proven techniques of informing, persuading, and motivating others.  By choosing their own topics and acting on ongoing peer feedback, students come to celebrate their existing strengths as communicators while targeting focused areas for maximum improvement.  In little time, all students reach heightened self-awareness, gain valuable confidence, and achieve distinct professionalism in the way they present themselves and their personal beliefs.
  This course does not count towards the four year English requirement.

English Learner Education (ELL)

The primary goal of the English Language Learner Program is to enable the English Language Learner to achieve communicative and linguistic competence in English and to perform in academic content classrooms with high expectations.  The core classes are divided into three levels, Entering/Emerging (ELL 1), Developing/Expanding (ELL II), Expanding/Bridging (ELL III).  At each level the four major aspects of language (speaking, listening, reading, and writing) will be mastered before moving to the next level.  Students practice all language skills in English and learn essential vocabulary and background information to foster success in content areas across the curriculum.

INNOVATION AND DESIGN THINKING CERTIFICATE PROGRAM

PURPOSE AND RATIONALE

Advances in technology have lead to increasingly rapid changes at the beginning of the 21st century.  The speed and impact of these advances  have created a contemporary culture that values innovation and discovery. The idea of STEAM education has risen in recent years as a response to the need for preparing young people with the skills to be creators of technology and culture and not simply consumers. While a student may learn the content of the individual disciplines of the STEAM acronym (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math), grouping them together implies an interdisciplinary approach. Work on teaching problem solving and thinking skills for effective application of STEAM education has lead to the concept of Design Thinking. Design Thinking encourages students to think deeply about a problem and to work collaboratively across disciplines to arrive at the best possible solution.

The AHS Innovation and Design Thinking Certificate is a program that students elect to participate in to foster the skills related to effectively applying their STEAM based skills and knowledge. Students will apply brainstorming and problem solving techniques to their project-based school work and document the process in a web based portfolio. The program will culminate in an independent project their senior year, overseen by an advisor, solving a real world problem that the student has identified. Students who meet the requirements will receive an AHS Innovation and Design Thinking credential on their transcript and be recognized for their focused interest and effort in STEAM related fields.

This course is recommended for students interested in pursuing a career in civil or mechanical engineering, drafting technology, or architectural design. This is a class that can go in many different directions -all depending on the choice of the student with guidance from the instructor. While C.A.D.D. is focused around digital drafting and design aspects (i.e., visual or creative projects involving a computer), there are also many additional features as well. In project-based curriculum, students work in an area of their own interest, generating works of their own inspiration. Within the class the flexibility exists to assign projects ranging in difficulty on the student's ambition and ability. Whether simply designing the blueprints of a house, modifying a preexisting plan, or creating a digitally enhanced pamphlet, students are the designers and researchers of their project. As students advance through the year, they learn how to take on greater challenges, including real jobs. Overall, C.A.D.D. is a great class for anyone. Students work hands-on creating computer-oriented projects that generate final products sparked by their own interests.

SCIENCE

The goal of the science department at AHS is to support all students in attaining content knowledge and complex reasoning skills necessary to understand the core areas of science as well as to become a scientifically informed citizen through hands-on laboratory experiences. We also strive to foster science-specific literacy in the reading, writing, and mathematics necessary for career and college readiness. Taking more than one science course during a given year (10–12) is possible with departmental approval. A four year science sequence can be generated from the table below. All science courses include laboratory experiences.

Since our science curriculum often involves application, spiraling and cross cutting of concepts, pre/co-requisites are highlighted in the program of studies for science progression.
9th grade students must take Physical Science as a precursor to the level of science knowledge expected at the high school, but more importantly for the laboratory skills acquisition necessary for higher level coursework.
Students take the Introductory Physics Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) science test near the end of the 9th grade. Passing a science MCAS is required to meet state and local graduation requirements.^
10th grade students take an Introductory Biology Course.
11th and 12th grade students are encouraged to explore areas of interest in the realm of science, and offer a variety of rigorous courses at appropriate levels. All students must take at least 3 years (15 credits) of science.
All college bound students should plan to take both Chemistry and Physics courses. These are core sciences, along with Biology, and expected by most competitive colleges. These courses are offered at various levels. There is a significant difference between the levels in these classes and can be taken on the academic, honors, and AP levels of rigor. Some of the differences are found in the content depth, pace, common assessments, pre-requisites, amount of time they require outside of class, expectations of independence in laboratory experiences, and differences in the course text.
We encourage any student who has an interest in an intended area of study to visit a college website and to obtain the academic plan. They will find in all STEM related or medical science research based career choices, these core science classes are highlighted.

^If a student does not pass the Introductory Physics MCAS after grade 9, but has passed the Physical Science course, they will move on to Biology and then take the Biology MCAS.

Global Competence Program

The Global Competence Program (GCP) is designed to foster students’ global awareness, and, in so doing, provide AHS graduates with the essential skills for participating in and contributing to an increasingly globalized society. Through coursework, community service, a global engagement project,  and foreign travel*, GCP participants will:
Think Globally: Have an increased knowledge of their relationship to the world; think about issues from a global perspective; gain an appreciation for other world cultures, viewpoints and perspectives.
Communicate Effectively: Improve their foreign language skills and their ability to communicate with people across cultural and language divides.
Contribute Responsibly: Use their global knowledge to interact and build relationships with people from other cultures; actively seek world knowledge to develop their own values and perspectives; demonstrate respect, open mindedness, understanding and flexibility in behavior and thinking; help others to embrace multiple perspectives.
 * Students who are unable to participate in travel may complete an alternative project.
The Global Competence Program is open to all students and students are encouraged to submit their Initial Application early in their high school career in order to have time to complete all required components. Upon successful completion, students will be awarded a Global Competence Certificate and pin for graduation.

Seal of Biliteracy

The Seal of Biliteracy is a distinction that encourages students to pursue literacy in two or more languages, honors the language skills our students attain, and serves as evidence of skills that are attractive to future employers and college admissions offices. Students meeting the Massachusetts Department Elementary and Secondary Education requirements for the Seal of Biliteracy will receive this designation in the form of an insignia affixed to their transcript or diploma during senior year. Arlington also partners with the Language Opportunity Coalition to offer supporting biliteracy awards.

World Languages Electives
The following courses are open to sophomores, juniors and seniors as electives, and do not count toward the two year language graduation requirement.

Digital Language Courses – Curriculum H
Students who are interested in learning a language that is not currently offered at Arlington High School may enroll in a fee-based online course through Brigham and Young University Independent Study program. While primarily an independent study course, weekly participation in the online learning activities, supervision by a World Language teacher, and weekly mandatory meetings for the first quarter are required. These courses are most successful for students who are highly motivated, independent and active learners; possess strong organizational and time management skills; have discipline to study without external reminders; and can adapt to new learning environments.

Registration payment to Brigham and Young University is required before the school year begins to reserve a place in the course; students may also be required to purchase a textbook.  Students must have the approval of a school counselor and the World Language Director prior to enrolling in a course.

Please note there is a fee associated with this course.  If interested please contact Dawn Carney, Director of World Languages.

Massive Open Online Course (MOOC)	Grade 12	      1.25 credits
Arlington High School is piloting the use of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to expand our offerings.  As the online world gives us access to courses, content, and teachers all around the world, we are working to discover new ways to take advantage of this potential.

A MOOC may be proposed by Faculty or Students (Juniors and Seniors).  The courses we are using are offered through Coursera (www.coursera.org).  We may expand to other providers in the future.  Course proposals will be evaluated by administration based on students served, whether they enhance our existing offerings, the quality and appropriateness of the content, and school resources available.  As Coursera courses vary in terms of their scope and rigor, they may be approved for from 0.5 to 5 credits.  Most will be offered at the AP level  weight. MOOCs at Arlington High School require a combination of participation in the online activities, supervision by an approved faculty member, and weekly one-hour mandatory meetings after school.  Upon completion of the 6 week course, students will be awarded a completion certificate from Coursera, and a grade to appear on their AHS transcript.  All required materials and fees will be paid by AHS.

If you are interested, send a proposal to the Principal stating:
The course you are interested in
The names of any interested students or faculty
The reason for choosing this course (students served, enhancement of our offerings, quality/appropriateness of the content)
A proposed timeline
A statement of resources needed (budget, equipment, facilities, time, schedule)

The Workplace Alternative Program

The Workplace alternative program, housed on the campus of Arlington High School, has three major components: academic, social/emotional support, and community involvement. The core curriculum meets the requirements of graduation from Arlington High School and is in alignment with the frameworks in Massachusetts.  The academic component covers English, history, mathematics, science, and physical education.  Social/emotional support is offered through the Omni course, small class sizes, and continued support from trained counselors, (Arlington High School Counseling and Arlington Youth Consultation Center). Also, in addition to their role as teachers, the Workplace faculty also serves as academic and career advisors. The Workplace program takes on many community service projects throughout the year with the goal of creating a sense of investment and pride in Arlington.

Workplace is a relationship-based program. Therefore, students who enter this program must be able to form meaningful relationships with adults. Students who are not appropriate for this program are those who are drug addicted, unwilling to participate in their own education, and those who are not committed to change. This program is a choice for the student to decide who they are and who they will become and that academic pursuit is worthwhile. The student decides that his or her attitude, behavior, and/or belief systems are open to change and the student is willing to explore and keep their options open for the future.

Workplace is an alternative regular education program at AHS to meet the needs of those students who benefit from learning in a different environment than the one provided in the traditional high school.  The Workplace focuses primarily on relationship building within the parameters of academic growth, social responsibility, emotional health, community awareness, and career possibilities.  Classes for Workplace students are small, individualized and structured.  The Workplace program offers a combination of challenging classroom experiences and specialized services.  A major component of the program is centered in the Omni Class where students work on self-awareness, group trust, leadership, and community service.

Placement Procedures and Criteria
Interested students are admitted to the program through an interview process involving the student, the student’s parent(s) and/or guardian(s), the Workplace staff and interested parties such as the student’s School counselor or referring faculty member.  Students may be referred to the program from various sources from within the school including the AHS Student Support Team.  A student may inquire about the program through his or her school counselor.  Spaces are limited and, therefore, admittance to the program is not always possible.  Students who enter this program do so voluntarily with a commitment to the program ideals of academic achievement and planning toward the pursuit of a productive future after graduating from high school.  All admissions are on a trial basis and continued participation in the program is contingent upon compliance with the contractual obligations.

In general, the students in the Workplace meet the following criteria:
The student is of average or above average cognitive ability.
The student is seeking post high school education, whether it is college, continued academic pursuit, or vocational setting.
The student shows motivation to improve skills and complete high school.
The student agrees to the program contract.

Workplace Course Offerings
English, History, and Science courses are offered at the Curriculum A level.  Mathematics is at the Curriculum B level, all of which satisfy the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks.  Curriculum matches topics offered in traditional academic courses at Arlington High School.

Specialized Programs
In order to offer a comprehensive continuum of programming for young adults with disabilities, Arlington Public Schools has developed several specialized programs that provide combinations of specialized and mainstream classes for identified students.  Facilitated with supports including special education teachers, tutors, teaching assistants and social workers, identified students are able to prepare for post-secondary transition to college and/or employment situations.  Students are identified for one of the specialized programs through recommendations from the evaluation team and the IEP process and have a disability diagnosis and academic profile that fits a particular program.
