Students are not allowed to take electives marked for Grade 11 and 12 only.  (each course is one quarter long)Grades 11 and 12: Students are required to take two quarter electives by the time of their graduation.  This may entail taking two quartered electives during your junior year, or one junior and one senior year. Spaces may be limited in some electives. Seniors are given preference. Grade 12 students cannot enroll in Quarter 4 PE electives because the length of 4 quarter 4 for seniors is shortened.There is a 4 absence allowance for all Quarter Elective classes. If a student surpasses the 4 absence allowance they must enroll in another elective in a different quarter to earn PE Graduation requirement credit and may require changes to their schedule in order to complete this requirement.*Covid-19 update:Members of the Class of 2022 enrolled in Term 4 Physical Education classes in 2020 will not have an opportunity to complete those credits because of our remote status in  the 2020 school year.  Making up this term in later years will substantially reduce opportunities for them to explore other academic offerings and will require them to take more than the usual amount of PE in one year."

The central aim is to foster critical reading and thinking about gender and the ways in which it is shaped by the interlocking systems of racism, sexism, ethnocentrism, heterosexism, ageism, ableism, colonialism and globalization; and how social movements have resisted these inequalities and worked to create new systems of change. We will scrutinize political, social and legal constructions of gender which continue to operate as though gender is binary, and explore a more inclusive approach which reflects a gender continuum within the context of entrenched power structures. Through understanding the construction of gender and its relationship with society, we will look for solutions to eradicate gender discrimination and gender-based violence."

To develop this foundation, students read classic and contemporary works, apply reading strategies, develop skills of literary analysis, and broaden their knowledge of literary terms.  The course involves the close reading and discussion of major literary genres including poetry, non­fiction, drama, the short story, and the novel. Because this course is a study of communication in all its forms, students also critically assess information in non-traditional “texts,” such as online media, advertisements, and news articles. Students compose literary analyses and expository essays with a clear focus, logically related ideas, and supporting detail to uphold their arguments. In creative writing, students work to develop a strong voice and to integrate literary elements, such as figurative language, characterization, and narrative structure. Students use their knowledge of the standard conventions of the English language to revise and edit their work. Students are encouraged to become active participants in the classroom through student-­centered discussions and oral presentations. To foster a positive attitude toward learning and to support students as they assume responsibility for their progress, the course provides instruction in critical thinking, reading strategies, and effective study habits. Other emphases include grammar and vocabulary development."

Through thematic units the students will explore purpose and audience, the tools of effective argument, the elements of style, and the use (and misuse) of language. Through close analysis and synthesis of a variety of texts, students will develop their expository, analytical, and argumentative writing skills to address the essential question: How does the study of rhetoric enable one to be a contributing citizen and a conscientious consumer? While students will read novels of American literature, equal emphasis will be given to classic essays, speeches, political tracts, and literary criticism from such authors as Frederick Douglass, Deborah Tannen, Brent Staples, Richard Rodriguez, Annie Dillard, Perri Klass, Henry David Thoreau, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King,  Amy Tan, George Orwell, and others.  AP students will be expected to read deeply, prepare oral presentations and lead discussions. Portfolios allow students to reflect upon their accumulated work and establish individual writing goals. Grammar instruction, based mainly upon student writing, targets sentence complexity, variety, and precision.

Students explore the essential questions “What does it mean to be American?” and ”How does the American Dream change over time?”  Specific themes include the transition from innocence to experience, the conflicts between the individual and society, the realization of a moral code, and the pursuit of happiness. Selected novels and plays from the list above are supplemented by short stories, poems, and essays. As readers, students are challenged to engage texts purposefully in order to make meaning, generate critical questions, observe connections among texts, and defend interpretations with relevant evidence.

It has inspired and informed works ranging from Homer’s classic epics to more contemporary forms such as rap and hip-hop.  More importantly, perhaps, it is a representation of our own life rhythm.  Seamus Heaney once wrote: “I rhyme to see myself.  To set the darkness echoing.”  In an effort to find our own rhyme, we will explore poetry from its most basic roots to its more sophisticated forms.  Instead of surveying poetry as a chronological timeline, we will bounce back and forth from the past to the present in order to discover how one has informed the other.  Haikus and sonnets, ballads and slam poetry will all receive equal attention.  Students will read, compose, and analyze poetry as an artisan might, by paying close attention to the process, the craft, and the history that informs our work.  While the majority of the writing in this class will be creative in nature, students will occasionally write expository pieces about poems as well.* Students have the option of earning Honors Credit through more challenging research and project work."

We will scrutinize political, social and legal constructions of gender which continue to operate as though gender is binary, and explore a more inclusive approach which reflects a gender continuum within the context of entrenched power structures. Through understanding the construction of gender and its relationship with society, we will look for solutions to eradicate gender discrimination and gender-based violence."

This half-year course of introductory meteorology will explore how the orbital mechanics of the Earth alter the way it absorbs energy from the Sun, thereby causing the air and water on the surface of the Earth to cycle and cause the various weather phenomena we experience throughout our lives. In addition to learning about the complex global climate systems that influence our weather, students will learn the basics of observing the environment around them to forecast local weather to come. Students will be expected to collect field samples and measure weather conditions numerous times throughout the course, so prepare to be outside throughout the seasons both in class and for homework.
