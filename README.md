# AHS Program of Studies Parse
Walter Vincent
Copy and paste Program of Studies into "Input.txt" and run.
Only works if course codes end in a "Z" (all ones I have seen do).
Outputs a json called "output.txt" containing the course code, name, grades, credits, category, description, and level.
# Dependencies
com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-core:2.7.5
com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.7.5 to make the json.
