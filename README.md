# AHS Program of Studies Parse
Walter Vincent <br />
Copy and paste Program of Studies into "Input.txt" and run. <br />
Only works if course codes end in a "Z" (all ones I have seen do). <br />
Outputs a json called "output.txt" containing the course code, name, grades, credits, category, description, and level. <br />
